	// In Java, we can achieve abstraction:
	// 1. with abstract classes
	// 2. with interfaces

	// Abstraction is when we focus on what object does instead of
	// how it does. We create abstract structure with abstract methods.
	// And then when concrete class implements our abstraction it
	// must implement (Override) all abstract methods.
	// - we cannot create object out of abstract class directly
	// - abstraction becomes useful when we have concrete classes.
	//   Concrete class is non-abstract class that extends abstract class
	//   or interface.
	// - The concrete classes must implement all abstract methods from abstraction.
	//   Implement means override.
